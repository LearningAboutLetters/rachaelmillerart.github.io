                <p class="introtext">Type classification is a system used to divide typefaces into categories. This is useful for several reasons: to help identify them historically, to distinguish them visually, and to assist in combining them. Most typefaces fall into four broad categories: serif, sans serif, scripts, and decorative. But within these groups are many subcategories. The classifications system below will give you a basic understanding of where the many thousands of typefaces come from, and how they differ.</p>

        <div class="pagetitle">Classificaiton</div>
        <div class="subtitle">Serif</div>
        <div class="subsubtitle">Old Style</div>
        <div class="bodytext">This category of typefaces originated between the late 15th and mid 18th century. It is characterized by curved glyphs with the axis inclined to the left, minimal contrast between thick-and-thin strokes, angled head serifs, and bracketed serifs (curves between the serif and the stem). Some typefaces in this category contain an e with a diagonal cross stroke.</div>
        
        <div class="subsubtitle" align="right">Traditional</div>
        <div class="bodytextright" align="right">Typefaces in this category represent the 18th century at a time of transition between old style and modern design. They have the following characteristics: the axis of the curved strokes is barely inclined or more vertical than diagonal, there is more contrast between thick and thin strokes than in old style typefaces, and serifs are thinner, flat, and bracketed.</div>
        
        <div class="subsubtitle">Modern (Neoclassical, Didone)</div>
        <div class="bodytext">Originating in the late 18th century, this refined and more delicate style is characterized by high or dramatic contrast between the thick and thin strokes, curved strokes on a vertical axis, and horizontal serifs with little or no bracketing.</div>
        
        <div class="subtitle" align="right">Sans Serif</div>
        <div class="subsubtitle" align="right">Grotesque</div>
        <div class="bodytextright" align="right">This style was the first popular sans serif. Its distinguishing features are slight contrast in stroke weight, a squared look to some curves, a “spurred” capital G, and a double-bowl lowercase g. Later versions lost their squared curve, and have a single-bowl lowercase g.</div>
        
        <div class="subsubtitle">Geometric</div>
        <div class="bodytext">These typefaces are based on simple geometric shapes, and usually including monowidth strokes and perfect circle rounded forms.</div>
        
        <div class="subsubtitle" align="right">Humanist</div>
        <div class="bodytextright" align="right">Humanistic type styles were an attempt to improve the legibility of sans serif designs by blending their structure with the classical Roman form. More simply, they are based on the proportions of Roman capitals and old style lowercase, with an apparent stroke contrast, as well as a calligraphic influence.</div>
